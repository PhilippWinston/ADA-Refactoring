# ADA-Refactoring

## Description

I was tasked to re-factor an existing HTML to be more ADA accessible. I was provided the HTML files and added a semantic labeling (Header, Main, Section, aside, and footer.), added alt tags for images, and cleaned up as I coded (making sure everything in the NAV bar what is the selectable for readers). Added the title section and easier to read spacing for coding and future upkeep for the site. 

The changes I added to the HTML will fallow ADA best practices and accessibility standards.

I learned the basics of ADA and WCAG, semantic labeling, ID & Class tags, and Elements.
